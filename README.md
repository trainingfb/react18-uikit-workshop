# `workshop-start` branch

The `workshop-start` branch is an empty version of this repository without content but already configured  with Cypress, Vitest, React Testing Library, Storybook and more...  

> I usually start my short masterclass (4 hours) using this branch so I don't need to explain how to configure everything and I save time.
Otherwise I explain every step from scratch, from configuration to writing tests, stories and so on
